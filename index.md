#Modular Patching and Programming for Realtime Media

Jamoma's essence is modularity: the ability to manage complex systems built up of flexible and interchangable modules.
To fully leverage Jamoma's power you make your own modules, but you can go a long way by using the existing library too.

Explore Jamoma's powerful communication, automation, and signal processing in a graphical patching environment like Max or take close to the metal and use the C++ systems directly.
